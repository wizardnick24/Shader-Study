1️⃣ Hardware options

3.5″ TFT / HDMI / SPI screen

If it’s HDMI, Pi 4B can drive it directly.

If it’s SPI (GPIO), you’ll need a driver/library (often comes with the screen). Performance is fine for static images.

Power: Same Pi power supply; TFT screens draw little extra.

Placement: Optional frame or case with the logo visible to anyone near the Pi.

2️⃣ Software options for displaying a logo
A) Static image (simplest)

Install fbi (framebuffer image viewer) for a simple full-screen logo:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install fbi


Show the image (assuming /home/pi/logo.png):

sudo fbi -T 1 -d /dev/fb0 -noverbose -a /home/pi/logo.png


-T 1 uses the first virtual terminal

-d /dev/fb0 points to the framebuffer (your screen)

-a scales the image to fit

You can add this to your Pi’s boot sequence so it automatically shows the logo on startup:

sudo nano /etc/rc.local


Before exit 0, add:

fbi -T 1 -d /dev/fb0 -noverbose -a /home/pi/logo.png &

B) Python GUI (optional, more control)

If you want more flexibility (animations, fade-in/out):

sudo apt install python3-pil python3-pygame


Python script (display_logo.py):

import pygame
import time

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((320, 240))  # adjust to your 3.5" resolution
logo = pygame.image.load("/home/pi/logo.png")
screen.blit(logo, (0,0))
pygame.display.update()
while True:
    time.sleep(1)


Run it in the background: python3 display_logo.py &

Can add animations later if desired.

3️⃣ How it fits with your audio stream

Audio pipeline: DarkIce → Icecast → website → VR shaders

Screen: displays logo locally, does not affect streaming

Low CPU use, headless otherwise

The Pi will simultaneously:

Capture audio via USB interface

Encode + stream to Icecast

Drive the 3.5″ display showing your logo

All of this can run on a Pi 4B 2 GB without issue.

If you want, I can make a full “headless streaming + logo display” setup including:

DarkIce + Icecast config for your UCA222

Systemd service to auto-run audio streaming

Auto-start of your 3.5″ screen logo

This would be “plug in RCA, boot Pi, streaming + logo live” ready-to-go.

Do you want me to do that?
